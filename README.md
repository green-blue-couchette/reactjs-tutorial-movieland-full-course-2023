# MovieLand - A tutorial project to help me re-learn ReactJS

This web app is my implementation of the MovieLand application from this tutorial:  
"React JS Full Course 2023 | Build an App and Master React in 1 Hour"  
1:11:43  
JavaScriptMastery, YouTube

Completed on Wednesday, October 25, 2023  
(This was, of course, not an exhaustive tutorial.)

I built this to help me re-learn ReactJS.  
My steps can be followed by looking at the commit history.  
I added some of my own improvements to the search experience (searching by pressing enter, clearing the search box when a search is made, a message that shows what search term was used) -- see the "Finishing touches" commits in the commit history.
